# No_death

greater than the fear of death. It is our greatest fear,
 the sum of all other fears.

We are afraid to die.
We are afraid of what happens when we die.

Death is the fundamental human problem.

Several years ago a friend sent me an email 
containing these lines from a poem called “Gray’s Elegy” 
written in a country churchyard in England:

The boast of heraldry, the pomp of power
And all that beauty, all that wealth e’er gave
Awaits alike the inevitable hour
The paths of glory lead but to the grave.

Life is short and so uncertain. “What is your life?
 You are a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes”
 (James 4:14b). Moses said to the Lord in Psalm 90:5-6, 
“You sweep men away in the sleep of death;
 they are like the new grass of the morning-though in
 the morning it springs up new, by evening
 it is dry and withered.” It is sometimes said that
 nothing is certain in life except death and taxes. 
But that is not wholly true. A clever man with a good
 lawyer can find a way around most if not all of his taxes,
 but no one escapes death. As George Bernard Shaw remarked, 
“The statistics on death have not changed. 
One out of one person dies.”

Worldwide, there are approximately 56,600,000 deaths each year.
 That works out to 4.7 million per month, 
155,000 per day, 6,500 per hour, 107 per minute, and
 1.8 per second. The Greek playwright Sophocles said it this way: 
“Of all the great wonders, none is greater than man. 
Only for death can he find no cure.”

Does death win in the end? On this side of the grave 
it’s hard to tell. Left to our observations, we don’t
 know much beyond the familiar words of Ecclesiastes.
 There is “a time to be born and a time to die”
 (Ecclesiastes 3:2). Visit any cemetery and you can’t 
really tell much difference between the Christian and the 
non-Christian. Oh, you can intuit something by reading the markers, 
but the dead lie buried side by side, six feet underground. 
There they are, all grouped together, young and old, male and female, 
rich and poor,
 famous and infamous, churchgoers and nonbelievers.
Or so it seems.

Death is not the end of the story for those who know the Lord. 
The Bible tells us what lies ahead for those who know Jesus.
 As we come to 2 Corinthians 5, we discover wonderful truths 
that give us hope as we face death with all its dark fears.

This passage as a whole is one of the most difficult
 among all the things Paul wrote, and yet once you get
 past the difficulties, there is a simplicity about 
it that attracts the believing heart. Even if we do not 
understand every detail, the first impression it leaves with
 the reader gives hope as we look ahead to the end of our earthly 
journey and wonder, “What’s next?” Paul tells us in very picturesque 
language that we have nothing to fear, that no matter how we die or when or where,
 and no matter what may be our physical condition at the moment of death,
 we have a promise from God that death itself cannot break.
